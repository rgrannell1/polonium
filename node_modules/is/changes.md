Is 3.0.0
---------------------------

Date: 2014-3-4

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Now includes very basic node/browser detection; is.js should work on both platforms.
* is.always, is.never, and their specialised children can now optionally take either a string
or a function to create an error message on failure. This overrides the default message.
* Added minified version.
