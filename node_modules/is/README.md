is v3.1.0
====================

Is.js wraps the following useful but cryptic one-liner for finding out the
type of a value in a way more reliable than `typeof`.

```js
Object.prototype.toString.call(val)
```

## Installation

```js
git clone https://github.com/rgrannell1/is.git
cd is
```

## Usage

Is.js is both a node.js and a web-JavaScript library.

```js
const is = require('is')

is.a         :: string x any -> boolean
is.what      :: any -> string

is.array     :: any -> boolean
is.boolean   :: any -> boolean
is.date      :: any -> boolean
is.error     :: any -> boolean
is.function  :: any -> boolean
is.location  :: any -> boolean
is.null      :: any -> boolean
is.number    :: any -> boolean
is.object    :: any -> boolean
is.regexp    :: any -> boolean
is.string    :: any -> boolean
is.undefined :: any -> boolean

```
